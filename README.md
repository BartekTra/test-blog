Very simple site i was coding while learning rails.
There are several issues (that i know of, there is surely much more than few) with this project I want to list here:
F*ed up tailwindcss styling, was doing it brainlessly just to save time in a few spots
Add more functionality to the website, it's boring as hell
Finish styling 
Write some tests in rspec, forgot about that while I was too focused on tailwind (still can't use it (: ). Needs to be done just to practice it.
emm idk have a nice day
